An improved 2D platformer
Welcome to Dunkin' Buddies. This game is a modified version of the classic Flappy Bird, featuring an exciting new power-up: the Size Adjustment Power-Up.

Features
Size Adjustment Power-Up: Collect special power-ups to change the size of the pipes dynamically.
Randomized Power-Up Spawns: Power-ups spawn randomly, providing unexpected challenges during gameplay.
Classic Flappy Bird Mechanics: Enjoy the familiar one-button control and navigate your bird through the pipes.

How to Play
Controls: Use the space bar or a mouse click to make the bird flap and avoid obstacles.
